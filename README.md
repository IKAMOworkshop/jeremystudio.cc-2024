# Portfolio 2024

Personal portfolio site for 2024 documenting previous works and added some new projects mainly focusing on webGL and other web technologies.

## Learnings

- Instead of using raycaster as navigation, maybe try to us HTML anchor tags as render targets, which is better for compatibility across devices and interactions.
- Theatre JS is perfect for large scale animation like a full page scroll animation or animating a scene. However, GSAP is faster to implement for smaller animations like transitions, hover, etc.
- Instead of using PlaneGeometry and ShaderMaterial for image thumbnail, perhaps try to use render target, which may provide more freedom and easier animations.
- Need to figure out a way to render for multiple page using render target in a more efficient way.
